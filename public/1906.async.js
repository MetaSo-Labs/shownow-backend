 * Psbt class can parse and generate a PSBT binary based off of the BIP174.

 * Creator: This can be done with `new Psbt()`
 *
 * Updater: This can be done with `psbt.addInput(input)`, `psbt.addInputs(inputs)`,
 *   `psbt.addOutput(output)`, `psbt.addOutputs(outputs)` when you are looking to
 *   add new inputs and outputs to the PSBT, and `psbt.updateGlobal(itemObject)`,
 *   `psbt.updateInput(itemObject)`, `psbt.updateOutput(itemObject)`
 *   addInput requires hash: Buffer | string; and index: number; as attributes
 *   and can also include any attributes that are used in updateInput method.
 *   addOutput requires script: Buffer; and value: number; and likewise can include
 *   data for updateOutput.
 *   For a list of what attributes should be what types. Check the bip174 library.
 *   Also, check the integration tests for some examples of usage.
 *
 * Signer: There are a few methods. signAllInputs and signAllInputsAsync, which will search all input
 *   information for your pubkey or pubkeyhash, and only sign inputs where it finds
 *   your info. Or you can explicitly sign a specific input with signInput and
 *   signInputAsync. For the async methods you can create a SignerAsync object
 *   and use something like a hardware wallet to sign with. (You must implement this)
 *
 * Combiner: psbts can be combined easily with `psbt.combine(psbt2, psbt3, psbt4 ...)`
 *   the psbt calling combine will always have precedence when a conflict occurs.
 *   Combine checks if the internal bitcoin transaction is the same, so be sure that
 *   all sequences, version, locktime, etc. are the same before combining.
 *
 * Input Finalizer: This role is fairly important. Not only does it need to construct
 *   the input scriptSigs and witnesses, but it SHOULD verify the signatures etc.
 *   Before running `psbt.finalizeAllInputs()` please run `psbt.validateSignaturesOfAllInputs()`
 *   Running any finalize method will delete any data in the input(s) that are no longer
 *   needed due to the finalized scripts containing the information.
 *
 * Transaction Extractor: This role will perform some checks before returning a
 *   Transaction object. Such as fee rate not being larger than maximumFeeRate etc.
